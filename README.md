Efficient Multiscale Modeling and Analysis (EMMA) is an open-source platform for performing multiscale modeling and data analysis for materials design. The platform is composed of four components:

1- Modeler

2- Simulator

3- Analyzer

4- Data inference

Our vision is that the workflow of computer-aided design of materials from bottom up can be, and should be, transparent and straightforward. For beginners, the platform serves as a playground to teach materials design. For advanced users and experts, the platform is flexible, and easy to extend, to customize the settings of the components and define new plugins for optimal configurations.
